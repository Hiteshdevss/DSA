**Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Preparation in TypeScript**

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to the preparation of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using TypeScript. Here, you will find various topics related to DSA along with their implementations in TypeScript. Whether you're preparing for coding interviews or enhancing your problem-solving skills, this repository aims to provide a comprehensive resource for your DSA journey in TypeScript.

## Topics Covered
1. **Arrays**: Basic operations, manipulation, searching, and sorting algorithms.
2. **Linked Lists**: Singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.
3. **Stacks**: Array-based and linked list-based implementations.
4. **Queues**: Array-based and linked list-based implementations, priority queues.
5. **Trees**: Binary trees, binary search trees (BST), AVL trees, and segment trees.
6. **Graphs**: Representation, traversal (DFS, BFS), shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford), and minimum spanning tree (Prim's, Kruskal's).
7. **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, and heap sort.
8. **Searching Algorithms**: Linear search, binary search, and interpolation search.
9. **Dynamic Programming**: Memoization and tabulation approaches, solving classic problems using DP.
10. **Divide and Conquer**: Understanding and implementing algorithms based on the divide-and-conquer paradigm.
11. **Greedy Algorithms**: Understanding the greedy approach and solving problems using greedy techniques.
12. **Backtracking**: Solving problems using the backtracking technique.
13. **Bit Manipulation**: Understanding bitwise operations and their applications in problem-solving.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the specific topic folder you want to explore.
3. Each topic folder contains TypeScript files with implementations and explanations.
4. Run the TypeScript files using a TypeScript compiler such as `tsc`.
   ```bash
   tsc filename.ts
   node filename.js
   ```
